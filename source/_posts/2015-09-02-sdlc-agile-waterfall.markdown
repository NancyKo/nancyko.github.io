If you've read articles on technology, worked in technology or even looked at some help wanted listings, you probably seen the words Software Development Life Cycle or SDLC or one of its methodologies.  Software development life cycle is a process that encompasses the design, planning, testing and delivery of a product. There are many methods but two I'd like to outline are Agile and Waterfall. 


Agile:  iterativative cycle where features are developed in whole and delivered to the client as they are finished. Some aspects of agile include: scrum, sprints, kanban, user story, test driven development.

If you're in a workplace that practices test driven development, some sort of unit tests will be written before any actual building.  They test the interface of a unit before implementation. Seems counterintuitive. 

Waterfall: Design and deveopment process in which the project is envisioned whole, developed whole, Q/A acceptanced tested as whole and delivered finished. Some aspects of waterfall include: requirement docs, gantt charts, project managers and a testing cycle.

There's little overlap between phases. So most of the requirements would be gathered before design of the product. Time spent on each phase increases with each progression of the cycle. Changes to requirements not easily welcomed.  After the product is delivered, suggestions for improvements are pooled and the process starts over again. 

These two methods aren't set in stone and some aspects can be incorporated into another, like test driven development. Right now, I don't see one method as being more superior over the other. Choosing the right process depends on what your're working on, your client and your product.
