Trying to learn something can be challenging.  You might not get everything at first, and have to move on to a new topic before ever feeling comfortable with the previous one. I never liked that feeling and always felt like I'll forget to go back to it later.  

A lot of people say, if you don't want to forget something to write it down. So making a list of every topic and learning objective to keep track of everything makes sense to me. I went through a few versions because it was challenging to make just a list for a high-impact learning enivornment. Learning something conceptually and then taking those concepts and applying them in a real-world environment, the list should reflect both conceptual and applied learning to be complete. I also wanted it to be more visual where I could get a sense of where I am at a glance. 

To make my list I started off with looking at each section of the curriculum and matching the name of the section with a column in my list and calling it 'Topic'.  Writing the specific learning objectives in the next column followed by whether it is the conceptual or the applied part of high-impact learning. And finlly, a column that acts as my marker of whether something is complete or can I do this and green and red fields just to make it more visual. 

After some tweaks and suggestions from others, here's what I came up with so far:

Conceptual:

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
The applied learning objectives ask for something to be done 
Applied:

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

When making my tracker, I like to have the 'Can I do this', 'Is this complete' column start off with 'No' because it feels really good when changing it to 'Yes'.
